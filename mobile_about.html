    <h1><u>Programming</u></h1>
    <p>In CSOC, we practice programming in many languages, though the most common are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python - A versatile language used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</li>
        <li>JavaScript - A scripting language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS - The standard markup language and styling sheets used for creating and designing web pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><u>Projects</u></h1>
    <p>Some good projects for learning how to code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CS50 Courses - Free online courses that cover the basics of programming, computer science, and web development using Python and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>High Seas - A program for students under the age of 19 to make their own projects, review other projects and get free stuff.</li>
        <li>Web Development - Create your own website or web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><u>Support<u></h1>
    <p>CSOC is a supportive community that helps each other learn and grow as programmers.</p>
    <p>Members can ask questions, get help with projects, and share their own knowledge with others.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we can help with learning how to use industry standard tools such as GitHub.</p>
